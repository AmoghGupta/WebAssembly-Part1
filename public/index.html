    <h1>WEB ASSEMBLY</h1>
    <h1>For writing c program and generating WASM go to https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/ or
        https://webassembly.studio/ for more advanced versions
    </h1>
    <p>Since we created a custom memory in JS for us to be used by WASM, we need to import that memory 
        to C but we cannot do that, so go to 
        https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/
        and build your c code and generate/copy the wasm generated in text format
        now go to https://webassembly.studio/ and open WAT(wasm as text) project and paste your wasm text 
        and now edit and import your memory code in WAT (wasm as text) file format and then rebuild and
        generate WASM file and add in your JS project
    </p>
